Witamy !

Let's say you are in Poland and want to order a drink.

You need to ask "One beer, please" : "Jedno piwo, poprosze"

"Jedno piwo poprosze" == Translator.orderingBeers(1)

But let's say you are really thirsty and want several beers. Then you need to count in polish. And more difficult, you need to understand the polish grammar and cases (nominative, genitive, accustative and more).

In english, the plural of "beer" is simply "beers", with an "S".

In Polish, the plural of "Piwo" (nominative singular) is "Piw" (genitive plural). Or "Piwa" (nominative plural). It depends !

The rule is :

-Usually, the plural is genitive (so "Piw")
-But after the numerals 2, 3, 4, and compound numbers ending with them (22, 23, 24, 32, 33, 34, x2, x3, x4 etc.), the noun is plural and takes the same case as the numeral, here nominative : "Piwa"
-And exception in the exception, for 12, 13 and 14, it's genitive plural, so "Piw". (yes, I know, it's crazy)

And the number are easy : From 0 to 9 :

"zero", "jeden", "dwa", "trzy", "cztery", "piec", "szesc" , "siedem", "osiem", "dziewiec"

From 10 to 19 : it's nearly the same, with "-ascie" at the end.

"dziesiec", "jedenascie", "dwanascie", "trzynascie", "czternascie", "pietnascie", "szesnascie", "siedemnascie", "osiemnascie", "dziewietnascie"

Tens from 10 to 90 : it's nearly the same, with "-ziesci" or "ziesiat" at the end.

"dziesiec", "dwadziescia", "trzydziesci", "czterdziesci", "piecdziesiat", "szescdziesiat", "siedemdziesiat", "osiemdziesiat", "dziewiecdziesiat"

Compound numbers are constructed similarly as in English (for example, 22 is "dwadziescia dwa") : tens + units.

And "One" could be male ("Jeden"), female ("Jedna") or neuter ("Jedno"), which is the case for Piwo. But the all other numbers are invariant. (even if using "jeden").

Ah, and by the way, I don't drink alcohol, so if no beers are ordered, ask for mineral water instead : "Woda mineralna".
